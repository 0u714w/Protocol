## Export Process

Steps:
- The app goes to the LinkedIn homepage.
- If the user is logged in, the app intercepts a LinkedIn API request and extracts the `csrf-token` and `cookie` tokens.
- The app makes a request to the following endpoint: `https://www.linkedin.com/voyager/api/relationships/dash/connections?${params}` to start the export process.
    - The parameters can be found in the `connections.js` file in the Desktop repository.
