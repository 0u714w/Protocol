## Export Process

Method: Intercepting Network Requests

Steps:
- The app goes to the Twitter homepage.
- If the user is logged in, the app intercepts the cookies and auth tokens.
- The app then uses these to export the user's bookmarks.
- More details can be found in the `network.ts` file in the <a href="https://github.com/surfer-org/Protocol/blob/main/desktop/src/main/utils/network.ts" target="_blank">repository</a>.
