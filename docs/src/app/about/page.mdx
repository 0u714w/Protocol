# About Surfer Protocol

## Our Mission

Surfer Protocol is an open-source framework dedicated to solving the challenge of personal data portability. We believe that your personal data shouldn't be trapped in silos across hundreds of platforms. Our mission is to make it easy to export, understand, and build applications with your personal data.

## Our Story

<CoverImage />

Founded by <a href="https://x.com/SahilLalani0" target="_blank">Sahil Lalani</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackblair876/" target="_blank">Jack Blair</a>, Surfer Protocol emerged from years of experience building AI agents, autonomous web browsers, and digital clones. We recognized that while AI technologies have become increasingly accessible, accessing and utilizing personal data remains a significant challenge.

## Technology

Surfer Protocol consists of three main components:
- A Desktop Application for data export
- Comprehensive Documentation
- Python SDK for developers

Our protocol is built on cutting-edge technology, combining the best practices from distributed systems and blockchain technology to ensure secure and efficient data portability.
