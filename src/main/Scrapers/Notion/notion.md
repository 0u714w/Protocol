# Notion

This module exports all workspace content from a user's Notion account.

## Functionality

The `exportNotion()` function performs these tasks:
1. Checks if the user is connected to Notion.
2. Navigates through the Notion interface to reach the export dialog.
3. Initiates the export of all workspace content.

## Implementation

The Notion export process is integrated into the main application via `preloadWebview.js`:
1. The `exportNotion()` function is imported from `notion.js`.
2. It's called when the 'export-website' event is received for Notion.
3. If the user isn't connected, a 'connect-website' message is sent back.
4. The export process is initiated through an IPC message from the main process.

## Platform-specific Considerations

1. DOM Manipulation: The module relies on specific class names and text content to navigate the Notion interface.
2. Timing: Fixed timeouts are used to account for page load and animation times.
3. Scrolling: Elements are scrolled into view before clicking to ensure visibility.

## Future Improvements

1. Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling for each step of the process.
2. Dynamic Waiting: Replace fixed timeouts with dynamic waiting for elements to appear.
3. Selective Export: Add options to export specific pages or sections instead of the entire workspace.
4. Progress Tracking: Implement a way to track and report the export progress.
