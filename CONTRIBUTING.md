## Platform-specific Modules

The Surfer project is designed to be modular, with each platform-specific scraping functionality encapsulated in its own module. For details on adding support for a new platform, please refer to our [Guide to Adding New Platforms](./docs/ADD_PLATFORMS.md).

## Helper Functions

Surfer uses various helper functions to streamline the scraping process. These functions assist with tasks such as waiting for elements, cleaning HTML, and managing asynchronous operations. For a complete list and detailed explanations of these helper functions, see our [Helper Functions Documentation](./docs/HELPER_FUNCTIONS.md).
