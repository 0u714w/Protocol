## About The Project

Surfer is the world's first digital footprint exporter, designed to centralize all your personal data from various online platforms into a single folder.

Currently, your personal data is scattered across hundreds of platforms and the companies operating these platforms have no incentive to give this data back to you. Surfer solves this problem by navigating to websites and scraping data from these websites.

We believe that personal data centralization is the key to enabling truly useful, universal personal assistants.

## Getting Started

To download the app, head over to [https://surfsup.web.app](https://surfsup.web.app). Or you can go to the releases page.

For instructions on setting up the app locally and contributing to the project, please refer to the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Usage

Surfer is designed to be your personal data aggregator, centralizing all your data from various online platforms into a single folder. This empowers you to:

1. Leverage the power of personal AI assistants by providing them with a comprehensive dataset about your life.
2. Take full control of your personal data and break free from the constraints imposed by the companies that currently hold it.

## Roadmap

### Short-Term
- [ ] Obtain a code signing certificate for Windows
- [ ] Replace `setTimeout` with `await` for script execution to ensure elements exist before scraping
- [ ] Implement robust error handling for the scraping process
- [ ] Add support for more online platforms

### Medium to Long-Term
- [ ] Implement concurrent scraping to allow for multiple scraping jobs to run simultaneously
- [ ] Adding sub-tasks within platforms (i.e. Twitter Bookmarks, LinkedIn Connections Data, etc)
- [ ] Integrate with other agentic frameworks like LangChain for advanced personal AI assistants
- [ ] Explore integration with wearable devices for enhanced personal data tracking and acknowledgment

See the [open issues](https://github.com/CEREBRUS-MAXIMUS/Surfer-Data/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
